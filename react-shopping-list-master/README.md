# React Shopping List
---

The ideia of this app is to compare shopping list prices from different places allowing the user to choose the best cost-benefit place.

* Features
> Add new items;
> Checks if the new item already exists in the list;
> Check or uncheck them (green / red);
> Change the item name;
> Remove items;

In order to run it, you will need to clone the project from my account and then run some commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/sergiogomes/react-shopping-list.git
npm install
webpack-dev-server
```
